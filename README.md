# Simple Calculator in Assembly Language

This is a **simple calculator** program written in **8086 Assembly Language** using the TASM/MASM assembler. The calculator provides six basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and factorial. It features an interactive interface where users can select their desired operation and input numbers.

   - Accepts two numbers and calculates their sum.
2. **Subtraction**
   - Computes the difference between two numbers.
3. **Multiplication**
   - Multiplies two numbers and returns the product.
4. **Division**
   - Performs integer division and provides both the quotient and remainder.
5. **Power of a Number**
   - Calculates the result of raising a base number to an exponent.
6. **Factorial**
   - Computes the factorial of a given number.
